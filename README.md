# Query a digital music store database
Query the Chinook Database using SQLite to understand the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information.

## Project Overview
- This project uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to query the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store.
- To better understande the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information, I answered the following questions:
  1. What is the genres' distribution?
  2. What is the most popular genre in each country?
  3. Who are the top 10 artists?
  4. What are the top 10 songs in term of purchases?
  5. What are the names of the customers who purchased the most in each country?
  6. Does long songs sell well?

Note: These questions are not the only questions that can be asked. They are the questions that I chose to demonstrate.

## Requirements
  1. Language: SQL
  2. Program: DB Browser for SQLite

## Project Data
The Chinook Database can be found in the chinook_db folder in this repository.
